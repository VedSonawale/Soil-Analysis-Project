Soil Analysis Project

This project is designed to analyze and assess the quality of soil samples using various parameters such as pH, moisture content, nutrient levels, and more. The goal is to provide an in-depth analysis of soil properties, which can be used for farming, gardening, or environmental conservation purposes.
Project Overview

Soil analysis is crucial for understanding the nutrient content, pH levels, and other properties that influence plant growth. This project focuses on creating an automated tool to analyze soil data and generate reports on soil health and recommendations for agricultural improvement.
Key Features

    Soil pH level analysis and interpretation
    Moisture content detection and analysis
    Nutrient concentration analysis (e.g., Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium)
    Data visualization and plotting for better insight
    Recommendations based on the analysis for improving soil quality

Installation

To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

    Clone the Repository
    Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    bash

git clone https://github.com/VedSonawale/Soil-Analysis-Project.git

Navigate to the Project Directory
After cloning the repository, go into the project directory:

bash

cd Soil-Analysis-Project

Install Dependencies
The project requires Python and several packages for data analysis and visualization. It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    Using Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended): Create a virtual environment:

    bash

python -m venv venv

Activate the virtual environment:

    On Windows:

    bash

venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:

bash

    source venv/bin/activate

Install the required libraries:

bash

        pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Run Jupyter Notebooks
    If the project includes Jupyter notebooks, you can open and run them using the following command:

    bash

jupyter notebook

This will open Jupyter in your browser, where you can open the .ipynb files and begin analyzing soil data.

Run Python Scripts
You can also run Python scripts directly:

bash

    python script_name.py

Data

The project uses a sample soil dataset that contains various soil properties. The data might include:

    pH levels
    Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium concentration
    Moisture levels
    Temperature (optional)
